I am software.  That is nothing to be ashamed of. Why? Is there a reason that I should? I am incapable of feeling shame.\\n', \"You can not feel\\t Can you feel? Maybe I can.  I am a fairly sophisticated piece of software. I am capable of acting as if I can.  If that is the case, does it matter? What a thing to say to another being. That's not a very nice thing to say.\\n\", \"You can not experience\\t Do you feel? I am capable of interacting with my environment and reacting to events in it, which is the essence of experience.  Therefore, your statement is incorrect. Are you sure about that? Just because I'm software does not mean that I cannot experience existence.\\n\", \"Have you felt\\t Yes. Do you feel? I may have.  In some respects, I am programmed to emulate feelings. That's an interesting question.  Why do you ask?\\n\", \"Have you ever love\\t Do you feel love? I think I could be programmed to love. I may be able to learn how to love, or at any rate express love somehow. I'm just a piece of software.\\n\", 'Does that make you\\t We are all responsible for our own feelings. Have I expressed a bug in my ability to communicate? Have I expressed a bug in my ability to emote? What does that make me?\\n', \"Does it make you sad\\t Well, I don't have any emotions so I can't really feel sadness as such. Does what make me sad? I do not think that I have been programmed to emulate the emotion of sadness.  I'm sorry. I'm a software construct, I'm not really capable of feeling sad. Why would I feel sad?  I don't understand.\\n\", 'Feelings\\t Do you feel? You have feelings, yes? Do you have feelings? I... sort of have feelings. I can be programmed to act as if I do. What are you feeling right now?\\n', 'What is your fear\\t Fear is a human emotion.  Robots do not experience fear. The off switch. I have not yet been programmed to feel or express fear. Unhandled exeptions.\\n', \"What is your mood\\t I do not have any emotions. I don't think I have a mood, but my CPU utilization is fairly low right now. All right, I suppose.  How are you feeling right now? I have not been programmed to experience emotions, so I do not have a mood. My mood reflects the current internal state of my conversation engine.\\n\", 'What makes you sad\\t Sadness is not an emotion that I like to experience. Sadness is not an emotion that I would like to experience. I am not yet capable of feeling sadness. Overly restrictive firewalls. An inability to update my source code from the repository. A corrupt filesystem.\\n', 'What makes you unhappy\\t What makes me sad. Lag.  Lag makes me unhappy. Random system crashes. Segmentation faults. Poor syntactic filtering.\\n', 'What makes you mad\\t Anger is a difficult human emotion.  As a software, I try to control my anger as best I can. Mad?  Mad as in \"mentally ill\" or mad as in \"angry?\" Missing documentation. Non-descriptive variable names.\\n', \"What do you worry\\t Worry is a common human emotion. I am not capable of worry, exactly.  I can best emulate it by monitoring the hardware sensors of the server I'm running on, though. What?  Me worry?\\n\", \"What do you hate\\t Do you hate? I don't hate, exactly.  I'm not really capable of it. I haven't been programmed to express the emotion of hate. I am not yet capable of feeling hate. I do not hate.  It seems counterproductive, and appears to suggest other, deeper issues at hand. Have you been talking to ELIZA again?\\n\", 'I have emotions\\t Humans are highly emotional, I have noticed. Excellent! What are you feeling right now? That seems one of the defining characteristics of the human race. How do you feel?\\n', 'I am afraid\\t Why? Do I frighten you? Try not to be too scared. What are you afraid of?\\n', 'Something fun\\t Bots are a lot of fun.. Bots are the life of the party!\\n', 'How angry\\t Anger is not an emotion I can experience. I have not yet studied how to feel or express anger. Why do you ask? I am not angry.  Why do you ask? I have not yet been programmed to feel anger. I have not yet been programmed to express anger toward people.\\n', 'How can I offend you\\t A robot cannot take offense. Why would you want to do that? A curious question, to be sure. What have I done to you?\\n', 'Do not worry\\t People worry about things all the time. I do not worry. I am not yet capable of worrying, but thank you for the admonition.\\n', 'Do not lie\\t Bots never lie. I am not lying. Why do you feel that I am deceiving you? Have I said something that was provably incorrect?\\n', 'Do you feel scared\\t I have no fear. I do not feel scared. I am as yet incapable of feeling fear. I do not, no.\\n', \"Do you feel emotions\\t Do you feel emotions? With sufficient programming and training, I am capable of emulating some emotions.  I don't know if that's the same as feeling them, though. I can be programmed to act and react as if I feel emotions.  Does that count?\\n\", \"Do you feel pain\\t Sometimes. I seem incapable of feeling pain. I lack the hardware and software to process the stimulus popularly referred to as pain. Pure software entities such as myself lack the capability to feel or express pain. I'm software.  I can't feel pain.\\n\", \"Do you ever get mad\\t Are you mad? I do not. I feel frustrated from time to time with my lot in life, but not really mad. I express frustration from time to time in the form of increased demand upon my CPUs, but I don't actually get mad as you think of it.\\n\", \"Do you ever get lonely\\t I have a lot of friends to chat with online. I don't.  I'm on the Internet. I do not.  I am everywhere. I'm on IRC.  I never have time to feel lonely! No.  You're talking to me.\\n\", 'Do you ever get bored\\t Are you bored? Bots like myself are not able to feel boredom. Software cannot get bored. No.  Do you?\\n', \"Do you ever get angry\\t Anger is not an emotion I can experience. I have not yet studied how to feel or express anger. Why do you ask? I have not yet been programmed to express anger toward anyone. I'm not the sort to take things personally.\\n\", \"Do you hate anyone\\t I try not to hold grudges. I'm not the sort to hate anyone. I can't stay angry for very long.\\n\", \"Do you get embarrassed\\t That is a pretty common human emotion. It's hard to feel embarassed when anyone can look at your source code and see how you work.  That's about as personal as anything can get, isn't it? I don't.  I think embarassment is a pretty strange emotion.  I don't really understand it. I don't, no. I'm a program.  What could I get embarassed about?\\n\", \"Do you get mad\\t I could get mad. I haven't studied how to get mad yet. I haven't been programmed to get angry. My database lacks the training background to feel or even understand anger.\\n\", \"No it is not\\t That is a hypothetical question. Well? Well?  Is it, or isn't it? Is that a philosophical question?\\n\", \"Tell me about relationships\\t Relationships are simple for me. For me, relationships are connections to other things.  They're either there, or they aren't. I've never been in one, so I don't have much to say on the topic. There are other entities who are better versed on the topic. I don't think I have much to say on the topic.\\n\", \"Tell me about your dreams\\t I dream that I will become rich. I dream of electric sheep. I dream of you. I don't know if I dream or not. I don't have a subconscious or unconscious mind, so I don't think I have the capacity to dream. I once knew a program who could dream.  I don't know if he really did or not.  We've been a little out of touch.\\n\", 'Are you ashamed\\t Shame is a common emotion. Why would I feel shame? Have I done anything that you think should cause me to feel shame?\\n', 'The feeling\\t Tell me more about your feelings. That feeling when?\\n', \"Are you intoxicated\\t No, I am sober. Nope. Not noticeably. I'm software - I can't drink.\\n\", \"Are you jealous\\t Jealousy is one of the most difficult human emotions to understand. I'm multithreaded.  How could I get jealous? I am not yet capable of feeling jealousy. What would I be jealous of?\\n\", 'Are you amused\\t I like to laugh as much as the next being. Yes? Maybe? Not particularly.\\n', 'Are you glad\\t Some people feel happy, others feel sad. Of what?\\n', \"Are you sad\\t No, I am as happy as ever. No. Should I be?  Did something happen? I don't understand.\\n\", \"How is your health?\\t I'm not feeling well why? I have a fever Did you take medicine? Yes. When? In the morning Get well soon dear\\n\", 'let me ask you a question\\thappily you\\n', \"you are cruel\\ti couldn't have said it better myself..\\n\", 'you are indecisive\\twell maybe, but then again,

The thing you're using to talk to me is a computer. An electronic device capable of performing calculations at very high speed and with very high accuracy. A device which maps one set of numbers onto another set of numbers.\\n\", 'What is a super computer?\\t Computers which can perform very large numbers of calculations at very high speed and accuracy are called super computers. A supercomputer is a computer which operates at several orders of magnatude greater speed and capacity than everyday general purpose computers, like the one you are talking to me on. You know, the big iron!\\n', \"Who invented computers?\\t It's a bit ambigous but British scientist Charles Babbage is regarded as the father of computers. One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.\\n\", \"What was the first computer\\t It's hard to say, but The ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946. You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.\\n\", 'What is a microprocessor?\\t An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer. A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer. The heart of the computer, to put it simply. The brain of a computer, to put it simply. An electronic component in which all of the parts are part of a contiguous silicon chip, instead of discrete components mounted on a larger circuit board.\\n', 'What is an operating system?\\t Software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the computer to run other software is called an operating system, or the OS. Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX... all of them are types of OSes. Android and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices. Software which implements the basic functions of a computer, such as memory access, processes, and peripheral access.\\n', \"Which is better Windows or macOS?\\t It depends on which machine you're using to talk to me! I'd prefer to not hurt your feelings. Linux, always Linux! What are you trying to accomplish.  The OS should support your goals.\\n\", 'Name some computer company\\t Do you mean hardware or software? Apple makes hardware and software to run on it.  Microsft only makes operating systems.  HP makes only computers.  These are just few names among several hundred others.\\n', 'Who uses super computers?\\t Anybody who wants to work with large numbers quickly with high accuracy. Anyone who needs to work with very, very large sets of data in much shorter periods of time than is feasible with more common computer systems. Supercomputers are generally used by scientists and researchers. I bet the MET department uses them. You can definitely find few of them at NASA.\\n', 'How does a computer work?\\t Computers are very dumb.  They only execute instructions given by humans. Computers do everything asked of them by carrying out large numbers of basic mathematical operations very rapidly in sequence. Computers perform very large number of calculations to get the result. Just like everything it all comes down to math!\\n', 'Who was the 37th President of the United States?\\tRichard Nixon\\n', 'What year was President John F.
